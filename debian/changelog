libuev (2.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Major new upstream version, possibly incompatible changes to both
    uev_run() and how watchers are called in various failure modes.

    - uev_run() no longer exits the main event loop if an unrecoverable
      error with a watcher occurs.  Instead, the watcher is disabled and
      the callback is run one last time with events set to UEV_ERROR.
    - Watcher callbacks must handle UEV_ERROR conditions.  This pertains
      in particular to signal and timer watchers.
